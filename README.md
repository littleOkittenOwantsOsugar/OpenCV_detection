# OpenCV_object_detection - Parking lot

This project uses OpenCV to detect and monitor available parking spaces in real-time. It was created as a learning exercise following a tutorial to understand the application of computer vision techniques in practical scenarios.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates the use of OpenCV to analyze video streams of parking lots and determine which parking spaces are occupied or available. It serves as a practical example of applying computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Features

- Real-time video processing using OpenCV
- Detection of parking lot spaces
- Classification of parking spaces as occupied or available
- Visual representation of parking space status
- Real-time updates on parking lot occupancy
